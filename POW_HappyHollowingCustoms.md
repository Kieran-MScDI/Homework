# Happy Hollowing Customs

|Case |Notes |
|--- |--- |
|**Dramatis Personæ** <br/> At the time of the ICS roll-out Port Botany in Sydney was handling $A100 Million in trade per day. Murray Harrison (a public servant) was the CIO for Australian Customs, Chris Ellison(Lib) was the Federal Government Customs Minister and Eric Roozendaal (Lab) was PortsMinister for the state of NSW. Tradegate Australia Ltd was established in 1989 to developand implement e-commerce services for Australia's international trade and transport industry.EDS is an international IT consultancy and outsourcing supplier. ICS is the Integrated CargoSystem (ICS), a key element of the Cargo Management Reengineering (CMR) programmeinitiated by the ACS. ICS replaced older systems like COMPILE and EXIT for managingimports and exports. The ACS is the Australian Customs Service. | Context | 
|**The ACS Expands Outsourcing Initiatives** <br/> In 1997 EDS, the global IT services company, secured a number of lucrative multi-annualservice and development outsourcing contracts with the Australian Customs Service (ACS).EDS (Electronic Data Systems, founded by Ross Perot) specialises in business process andIT outsourcing services. Prior to the outsourcing contract with EDS the ACS managed,developed, deployed and delivered its core back-end systems almost wholly in-house. Afterthe outsourcing deal, responsibilities for the ACS's core IT systems <mark>transferred over to EDS with gradually less direct involvement by ACS internal staff</mark>. Around this time <mark>Tradegate executives commented</mark> that the shift of system maintenance and development responsibilities(in additional to operational services) from ACS personnel to EDS resulted in a <mark>virtualshutdown in cooperation between the technicians on the 'inside' (of ACS-EDS) and those onthe 'outside' (Tradegate)</mark>.<mark>The new supplier had no interest in involving Tradegate, you might say they went out of theirway to ignore them. [Tradegate member]</mark> We're all the <mark>victims of the tendering process</mark>. It was driven by the Department of Finance, theTax Office. <mark>It was all about finance, cost savings, and Tradgate got slated</mark>. [Customs]One consequence of the ACS-EDS deal was that the <mark>ACS lost more and more of its ownspecialist Customs IT expertise as employees transferred into EDS and then gradually movedon into other areas in EDS globally.</mark> Staff <mark>transfers from ACS to EDS also altered the apparent cost structure for getting regular work done, for example the ACS paid contractor rates for the services of EDS consultants</mark>, many of whom had previously been public servantsfor the ACS. *Customs IT people had opportunities to join EDS, a lot of them did, a civil servant's pay isn't great, but some stayed, for different reasons.* [Customs IT] *It creates tensions, side by side, people you used to work with but now they're getting paidmore, a lot shipped out, <mark>our knowledge has a value elsewhere in the organisation</mark>* [EDS]. [ex-Customs IT now EDS consultant] | ACS = Client. <br/> EDS = BPO & ITO Services. <br/> Tradegate = Represents ACS clients/users of the system. (lookup https://tradegate.au/about) <br/> Knowledge exodus, poorly defined requirements and cost structure. <br/> Tradegate not part of the tender process. | 
|**CMR and ICS** <br/> In 1998 the ACS and EDS announced a <mark>massive $A25 million programme of IT systems renewal called CMR (Cargo Management Reengineering)</mark>. The CMR was going to be the Australian Customs Service's next generation IT system; a single system for managing, recording and controlling the movement of all goods movements into and out of the country.<mark>The Minister had made commitments in Parliament and the Customs IT innovation plans had been talked about nationally and internationally</mark> for several years. <mark>The proposed Integrated Cargo System (ICS) was to be the heart the CMR project</mark>. ICS would replace the ACS's venerable EDI based COMPILE system.<mark>They [EDS] send in the 'A-Team' to get the CMR and ICS deals.</mark> They won. The 'A-Team'gets the deal <mark>the 'D-Team' gets to deliver it</mark>... people moved, Customs was hollowed out. [Customs IT staff] It was a huge strategic shift, going from a 'community portal' sitting on top of Customs' EDIinterfaces on mainframes to Customs outsourcing development and delivery to EDS. [Industry observer] After <mark>over five years of development, delays and</mark> an increasingly<mark> fraught relationship</mark> between the ACS and EDS, ICS finally went 'go-live' on October 12 2005. <mark>Its users were compelled to switch over to the new system</mark> from an electronic trade management system that had served them for over 15 years. | Political. <br/> 'A' teams sales to 'D' team implementation indicating poor view of services supplied and something that could have been a requirment element in contract. <br/> Existing system had served well, but reason(s) for change not discussed; 1. what new value was the new system bringing, 2. Was old hardware or legacy system vulnerabilities a driver for the initiative. |
|**The ICS go-live, October 2005** <br/> Up to the point of ICS go-live Tradegate had provided essential front-end services on top ofthe ACS back-end. The existing system worked and was integral to the smooth operation ofthe national import and export system. It delivered high availability, responsiveness, and functionality for interactive or batch operation. <mark>On the ICS go-live day the old systems were simply turned off!</mark>...they brought us in for training three months before go-live. [Trader] <mark>Only a couple of the biggest importers were involved in user acceptance</mark>, I'm not even surethey were involved at the early stages for user requirements. [Trader] ICS has the requirements of <mark>other government departments: Border Protection, Statistics,Taxation. But no business logic worth talking about.</mark> [Trader] The operation of the new system was marred by widespread problems. <mark>Security access flaws allowed users to access and view other Traders’ import documentation</mark>, revealing confidential information like price, supplier details, quantities and delivery dates. The system was also <mark>perceived to be unreliable, badly designed, slow and buggy</mark>. Errors come back <mark>ages after</mark> you make a clearance request. Why didn't the computer system pick up on it first? [Trader] The error handling has problems, delays, I'm still waiting for responses to messages [in thesystem]. I might have 20 messages queued somewhere, meanwhile our containers are sittingon the tarmac at Kingsford-Smith (Sydney Airport). [Trader] <mark>A couple of weeks after ICS go-live the key seaports, Port Botany and Melbourne Port, had ground to a halt</mark> as containers piled up. Trade effectively stopped due to ICS processing delays or other problems with the new systems. Australia's trade clearance system <mark>ground to a halt from October 12 and for the next six weeks containers and cargo accumulated at portsand bonded warehouses</mark>. The situation reached crisis point when <mark>Port Botany and Port of Melbourne ran out of room </mark> to store uncleared containers. The clearance backlog came about partially because <mark>ICS throughput was just 30% of normal handling rates</mark>, this lead toexcessive cargo dwell times at airports and sea ports. I need Customs clearance to move them out of the port. [Trader] <mark>That's the power of Customs, we are just pleased if we get their attention.</mark> [Trader] The spectre of vessels (sea and air traffic) unable to disembark cargo was now a fact, Australia’s connections with the international trading system had seized up. The system has fallen apart. Traders are getting <mark>seven days turnaround instead of seven minutes.</mark> In <mark>COMPILE declarations had 98% success</mark> on first time entry. In <mark>ICS,</mark>, at roll-out we <mark>started with 60%</mark>, that's 40% fail! It improved slowly, 60%, 70%, 80%. [Tradegate employee] Let me put it like this, ICS was already a couple of years 'late'. Even when the pilot roll-outstarted in March 2005 it was obviously generating problems. <mark>Parallel running was a complete failure because no one was going to switch over until they shut down COMPILE.</mark> There was apush to switch people in July and then finally they shut down COMPILE in October and the problems grew and grew with the shipping volumes. For traders the run up to stocking Christmas shelves starts in August and goes exponential. That's when we found ourselves ina full-blown crisis; Airports 'chock-a-block', container terminals full, container ships parked off-shore unable to unload. Worse and worse, so no, we did not have a happy Christmas! [Trader] | 30% processing rate may have been eased with widespread training and testing ahead of release, but there should be an expectation that new systems will take time for people to gain confidence in its use and for unexpected bugs and usage methods to reveal themselves. The language is emotive, the closed approach to the development of the new system is a factor in the failure, people and organisations felt left out and not part of the of or important to the design and roll-out leading to a lack of engagement and support when it came to switching over, the parallel system period was wasted.|
|**Postscript** <br/> A year later Senator Joe Ludwig (Lab), speaking to the Customs Brokers and Forwarders Council of Australia, reflected on the aftermath of the CMR programme and the ICS roll-out in particular. By this time Customs had a new CEO, Michael Carmody."The Cargo Management Re-engineering project, which was part of the trade modernisation agenda will be remembered as one of the all-time greatest implementation failures of a government project in Australia’s history. Its budget blew out to ten times the originalestima te, it saw constant delays and, when finally switched on, it nearly brought downAustralia’s trade industry."

## Reading ##

Giddens 1982
Psychological Security. Brokerage, Signalling and the Third Man. (Abstract) (p. 232, para. 1)
Risk Rational approach, not considering how it is experienced. (p. 233, para. 2)
NetTrade case, IndiaSoft offshoring supplier.
Courtship AND cohabitation.
(p. 234, para. 3):
"According to Giddens, trust is inherently connected to absence (there is no need to trust what one can directly monitor), and is bound up with the organization of ‘reliable’ interactions across time–space."  My thoughts on this are that this is not just physical absence but also absence of knowledge, like the trust we might have with a doctor, we must trust that the injection will help us. In the case of a doctor there is, generally, already trust associated with the domain; white coat and stetoscope implies they know what they are doing, but wher edo we see this type of established trust in business? 

(p. 234, para. 7):
"experts must make a strict division between ‘frontstage’ and ‘backstage’ performance at access points, and the control of threshold between the two is the essence of professionalism." Is 'frontstage' a barrier to psychological security? 

(p. 235, paras. 3-4):
**Ability (knowledge/skill), Benevolance (want to help), Integrity**
"means of establishing or producing trust are required as a basis for cooperation. Zucker identifies three key modes of trust production in the modern world (Zucker, 1986):
process-based (information based on personal experience), characteristic-based (information based on ascribed characteristics), and institutional-based (formal protection against default)."
(p. 235, para. 5):
"Information about prior exchange histories can be obtained by engaging in repetitive exchanges with a party and, therefore, such informal trust-producing mechanisms ‘require extensive interaction over long periods of time and/or produce trust between a small number of individuals involved in a limited set of exchanges’ (Zucker, 1986: 62)."

(p. 236, para. 3):
"characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, family background, or age may be used as an index of trust in a transaction, as they ‘serve as indicators of member ship in a common cultural system, of shared background expectations. In general, the greater the number of social similarities (dissimilarities), the more interacts assume that common background expectations do (do not) exist, hence trust can (cannot) be relied upon’ (Zucker, 1986: 63). Furthermore, as in the case of reputations, stereotypes or preconceptions are not easily changed, even in the face of challenging evidence."

(p. 236, para. 7):
"key personnel at NetTrade were requested to keep a written journal, reflecting on their interactions with IndiaSoft, particularly during their early visits to India. Herein, they recorded their impressions and observations at critical junctures in the project. Obviously, our presence in the workplace, and respondents’ awareness that their journals would be read by us, inevitably had a bearing on their actions and reports. This, however, was mitigated to some extent by the fact that we developed good relationships with participants over time, and by our efforts to deliberately cultivate an open, reflective, learning culture around the offshoring project."

(pp. 238-240):
IndiaSoft humility and hunger reflected Irish programmers attitudes in the past. Also "Belevolance". 

(p. 240, para. 3):
 "John and Niall spoke often about the (much less tangible) ‘good vibes’ that they constantly got from IndiaSoft and the important role that this played in their decision making. In this regard, we are reminded of Giddens’ assertion that trust is always blind and that it involves an emotional, as opposed to a cognitive, commitment to a given set of outcomes."

(p. 242, para. 3):
"On the advice of friends, John made it very clear to IndiaSoft at the outset that he was keen to inspect the resume´s of all staff assigned to the project. He later confessed that, despite the fact that he found it difficult to make sense of them, his main intention was to signal to IndiaSoft that he was being very vigilant and watching things closely". Along with the use of omitting to mention a PM in discussions while prasing another John was able to get his message across without the more direct approach which IndiaSoft was finding uncomfortable.
