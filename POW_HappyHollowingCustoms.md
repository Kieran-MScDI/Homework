# Happy Hollowing Customs

|Case |Notes |
|--- |--- |
|**Dramatis Personæ** <br/> At the time of the ICS roll-out Port Botany in Sydney was handling $A100 Million in trade perday. Murray Harrison (a public servant) was the CIO for Australian Customs, Chris Ellison(Lib) was the Federal Government Customs Minister and Eric Roozendaal (Lab) was PortsMinister for the state of NSW. Tradegate Australia Ltd was established in 1989 to developand implement e-commerce services for Australia's international trade and transport industry.EDS is an international IT consultancy and outsourcing supplier. ICS is the Integrated CargoSystem (ICS), a key element of the Cargo Management Reengineering (CMR) programmeinitiated by the ACS. ICS replaced older systems like COMPILE and EXIT for managingimports and exports. The ACS is the Australian Customs Service. | | 
|**The ACS Expands Outsourcing Initiatives** <br/> In 1997 EDS, the global IT services company, secured a number of lucrative multi-annualservice and development outsourcing contracts with the Australian Customs Service (ACS).EDS (Electronic Data Systems, founded by Ross Perot) specialises in business process andIT outsourcing services. Prior to the outsourcing contract with EDS the ACS managed,developed, deployed and delivered its core back-end systems almost wholly in-house. Afterthe outsourcing deal, responsibilities for the ACS's core IT systems transferred over to EDSwith gradually less direct involvement by ACS internal staff. Around this time Tradegateexecutives commented that the shift of system maintenance and development responsibilities(in additional to operational services) from ACS personnel to EDS resulted in a virtualshutdown in cooperation between the technicians on the 'inside' (of ACS-EDS) and those onthe 'outside' (Tradegate).The new supplier had no interest in involving Tradegate, you might say they went out of theirway to ignore them. [Tradegate member]We're all the victims of the tendering process. It was driven by the Department of Finance, theTax Office. It was all about finance, cost savings, and Tradgate got slated. [Customs]One consequence of the ACS-EDS deal was that the ACS lost more and more of its ownspecialist Customs IT expertise as employees transferred into EDS and then gradually movedon into other areas in EDS globally. Staff transfers from ACS to EDS also altered theapparent cost structure for getting regular work done, for example the ACS paid contractorrates for the services of EDS consultants, many of whom had previously been public servantsfor the ACS.Customs IT people had opportunities to join EDS, a lot of them did, a civil servant's pay isn'tgreat, but some stayed, for different reasons. [Customs IT]It creates tensions, side by side, people you used to work with but now they're getting paidmore, a lot shipped out, our knowledge has a value elsewhere in the organisation [EDS]. [ex-Customs IT now EDS consultant] | | 
|**CMR and ICS** <br/> In 1998 the ACS and EDS announced a massive $A25 million programme of IT systemsrenewal called CMR (Cargo Management Reengineering). The CMR was going to be theAustralian Customs Service's next generation IT system; a single system for managing,recording and controlling the movement of all goods movements into and out of the country.The Minister had made commitments in Parliament and the Customs IT innovation plans hadbeen talked about nationally and internationally for several years. The proposed IntegratedCargo System (ICS) was to be the heart the CMR project. ICS would replace the ACS'svenerable EDI based COMPILE system.They [EDS] send in the 'A-Team' to get the CMR and ICS deals. They won. The 'A-Team'gets the deal the 'D-Team' gets to deliver it... people moved, Customs was hollowedout. [Customs IT staff]It was a huge strategic shift, going from a 'community portal' sitting on top of Customs' EDIinterfaces on mainframes to Customs outsourcing development and delivery toEDS. [Industry observer]After over five years of development, delays and an increasingly fraught relationship betweenthe ACS and EDS, ICS finally went 'go-live' on October 12 2005. Its users were compelled toswitch over to the new system from an electronic trade management system that had servedthem for over 15 years. | |
|**The ICS go-live, October 2005** <br/> Up to the point of ICS go-live Tradegate had provided essential front-end services on top ofthe ACS back-end. The existing system worked and was integral to the smooth operation ofthe national import and export system. It delivered high availability, responsiveness, andfunctionality for interactive or batch operation. On the ICS go-live day the old systems weresimply turned off!...they brought us in for training three months before go-live. [Trader]Only a couple of the biggest importers were involved in user acceptance, I'm not even surethey were involved at the early stages for user requirements. [Trader]ICS has the requirements of other government departments: Border Protection, Statistics,Taxation. But no business logic worth talking about. [Trader]The operation of the new system was marred by widespread problems. Security access flawsallowed users to access and view other Traders’ import documentation, revealing confidentialinformation like price, supplier details, quantities and delivery dates. The system was alsoperceived to be unreliable, badly designed, slow and buggy.Errors come back ages after you make a clearance request. Why didn't the computer systempick up on it first? [Trader]The error handling has problems, delays, I'm still waiting for responses to messages [in thesystem]. I might have 20 messages queued somewhere, meanwhile our containers are sittingon the tarmac at Kingsford-Smith (Sydney Airport). [Trader]A couple of weeks after ICS go-live the key seaports, Port Botany and Melbourne Port, hadground to a halt as containers piled up. Trade effectively stopped due to ICS processingdelays or other problems with the new systems. Australia's trade clearance system ground toa halt from October 12 and for the next six weeks containers and cargo accumulated at portsand bonded warehouses. The situation reached crisis point when Port Botany and Port ofMelbourne ran out of room to store uncleared containers. The clearance backlog came aboutpartially because ICS throughput was just 30% of normal handling rates, this lead toexcessive cargo dwell times at airports and sea ports.I need Customs clearance to move them out of the port. [Trader]That's the power of Customs, we are just pleased if we get their attention. [Trader]The spectre of vessels (sea and air traffic) unable to disembark cargo was now a fact,Australia’s connections with the international trading system had seized up.The system has fallen apart. Traders are getting seven days turnaround instead of sevenminutes. In COMPILE declarations had 98% success on first time entry. In ICS, at roll-out westarted with 60%, that's 40% fail! It improved slowly, 60%, 70%, 80%.[Tradegate employee]Let me put it like this, ICS was already a couple of years 'late'. Even when the pilot roll-outstarted in March 2005 it was obviously generating problems. Parallel running was a completefailure because no one was going to switch over until they shut down COMPILE. There was apush to switch people in July and then finally they shut down COMPILE in October and theproblems grew and grew with the shipping volumes. For traders the run up to stockingChristmas shelves starts in August and goes exponential. That's when we found ourselves ina full-blown crisis; Airports 'chock-a-block', container terminals full, container ships parked off-shore unable to unload. Worse and worse, so no, we did not have a happyChristmas! [Trader] | |
|**Postscript** <br/> A year later Senator Joe Ludwig (Lab), speaking to the Customs Brokers and ForwardersCouncil of Australia, reflected on the aftermath of the CMR programme and the ICS roll-out inparticular. By this time Customs had a new CEO, Michael Carmody."The Cargo Management Re-engineering project, which was part of the trade modernisationagenda will be remembered as one of the all-time greatest implementation failures of agovernment project in Australia’s history. Its budget blew out to ten times the originalestima te, it saw constant delays and, when finally switched on, it nearly brought downAustralia’s trade industry." [Senator Joe Ludwig (Lab)] <br/> | |
