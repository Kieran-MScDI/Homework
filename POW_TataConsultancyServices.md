# Case Study: TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES: BUILDING CAPABILITIES AND LEADERSHIP
## Credibility: 1970s-1990s

| Case Text | Notes | 
|--- |--- |
|In 1968, Tata Sons in India established Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as a division to service its electronic data processing (EDP) requirements and provide management consulting services. Over the next few years, a few young engineers at TCS realized that they were staring at a potential new business opportunity and started offering data processing services to clients outside the group.|  |
|India's first-generation computer experts felt handicapped by an outmoded computing environment in the country. When TCS started, there were only 17 computers in the entire country. The first break through in India came in 1969 when TCS won a contract from Central Bank of India to automate branch reconciliation processes. But progress was slow because India's foreign exchange laws made it difficult to import hardware.<br/> As a result, TCS became the exclusive distributor for the main frame computer maker Burroughs and simultaneously started doing programming for the hardware maker's customers in the US. Using its export revenues. TCS was able to bring in new computers, enabling the fledgling company to keep pace with the evolving needs of its growing client roster in the US. <mark>The defining moment for the Indian software industry came in 1974 when TCS won a large export project for the Detroit Police Department. This was followed by other projects in the US and UK, and thus the notion of offshore services, or the ability to provide services from remote locations, was born.</mark> Without an adequate telecommunication infrastructure, programmed tapes were sent on weekly flights to the US, while software requirements came through the postal services.| Success in Detroit led to more successes, I am surprised at how early this was in ICT history and the methods necessary to communicate requirements and transport code. | 
| In 1977, the Indian government enacted a legislation forbidding foreign firms from operating fully owned subsidiaries in India. As a result, IBM chose to leave India, a decision that opened up a new window of opportunity in India: as its core competency. TCS installed hardware and systems software and created and ran data centers. <br/> From the 1980s, TCS expanded aggressively. The average size of its deals grew beyond 25 person-years to over 100 person-years. In 1988, with improvements in telecommunications, <mark>TCS began to drive the offshore business by installing a water-cooled IBM 3090 mainframe, an aggressive move for a company that decided to invest heavily in a single machine with substantial export guarantees to the government. The gamble paid off and eventually led to a complete redefinition of the business model that in turn sparked the creation of today's $60 billion Indian IT industry.</mark>  <br/>With its business growing steadily in the 1980s, TCS became the hub for new technology knowledge in India. It started creating opportunities for Indian IT professionals with focused academic-industry partnerships beginning with IIT Bombay and IIT Kanpur, followed by new engineering colleges with course design and faculty development programs. By the end of the 1980s, a robust system was in place for the education and research needs of the country's IT professionals. <br/> In 1981, <mark>TCS established India's first IT R&D division</mark>, the Tata Research Design and Development Centre, at Pune. Simultaneously <mark>TCS worked closely with the Indian government on regulatory issues.</mark> <br/> Because computers were still scarce, the improvement of processes to increase productivity became a focus for TCS. Quality became a cornerstone for TCS first and subsequently for the entire IT industry in India. The relentless pursuit of excellent quality began to draw the attention of customers and competitors alike. <br/> | The Academic and Government partnerships developed at this time gave a clear advantage for further development with all participants benefitting. | 
## Scale: 1990s-2004
| Case Text | Notes |

| With the end of the century approaching and the impending Y2K problem looming ahead, TCS was becoming known for its software factory, a development that helped it leapfrog into the global environment. TCS spread its footprint worldwide by setting up global development and nearshore delivery centers in Hungary, China, Uruguay, Brazil, Japan, the US, and Canada. By the 1990s, the dot-com boom had the IT industry on steroids making it a highly lucrative sector.<br/> By the 1990s, the dot-com boom was firmly entrenched, and it became a period of exponential growth for TCS, which saw its first change of the guard. The visionary Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-trained electrical engineer who had started TCS, F. C. Kohli, stepped down as he passed the leadership to Subramaniam Ramadorai who had the drive, rigor, and passion to lead TCS through its next phase of growth.<mark> Taking over as CEO in 1996, Ramadorai made organizational changes beginning with a more empowered management style. Having grown from the ranks and served TCS in different departments, his understanding of the organization was deep, and his vision was to take TCS into the global top ten league of IT services companies.</mark><br/> Under his leadership, TCS was restructured into a domain-led organization, capabilities evolved to deliver end-to-end solutions, and uniform organization-wide quality processes were introduced and reinforced.<br/> TCS became the world's first organization to achieve an integrated enterprise-wide maturity level 5 on both the capability maturity model and people capability maturity model (frameworks conceptualized by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University to benchmark and appraise the software process and people management process of an organization).<br/> | Having new leadership that had risen through the ranks worked well allowing smooth transition of the organization's leadership while introducing management changes recognized during his career. |
| As the offshore model of software development gained currency among global corporations, Ramadorai played an active role in establishing offshore development centers in India to provide high-end quality solutions to major corporations such as HP and GE. Under his leadership, technology excellence centers were set up in India with a vision of remaining abreast with changing technologies at all times.<br/> TCS's internal operational efficiency was given a boost by an enterprise-wide digitization initiative.<mark> A turning point in 1989 was SEGA, a project that involved designing, building, and implementing on a turnkey basis a new system for the Swiss Corporation for Securities, Clearing and Settlement. The 350-person-year project went live on schedule and established TCS as a global technology partner with unmatched credentials for delivery excellence. This provided a platform for TCS to build India's financial and capital market infrastructure, including the state-of-the-art National Stock Exchange, among the biggest exchanges in the world in terms of volume, as well as a national securities depository that made the Indian stock markets paperless.</mark><br/> New horizons emerged for the business, including addressing the Y2K problem before the end of the millennium, and developing e-business, BPO, and engineering services. <mark>TCS's global growth saw an expansion in its customer list, its global network and presence, and increased interaction with professional groups, and it earned a greater presence in the Indian government on policy matters.</mark><br/> In 2003, TCS became India's first billion-dollar IT services company. The following year, it went public through an initial public offering that at that time was the largest ever such offering.<br/>| Again we see success building more success, this time not just to expand global business but also in providing national services and increased collaboration in policy making. |
## Leadership: 2004-2011

As the Indian economy continued to grow, the need for technology to drive growth became part of the national agenda. TCS, which had been investing in the domestic IT market since its inception, was well positioned to help the government at the central and state levels in its new initiatives. India's largest IT company was firmly in the spotlight, not only as the jewel in the Tata Group's crown but also because of its growing global presence.<br/> Strategic acquisitions were also playing a role to position TCS for future growth. TCS had acquired CMC in 2001, prior to the IPO, to expand its presence in the domestic market and joint ventures in the BPO space. In 2005 and 2006, <mark>it acquired FNS, an Australian software products firm, and Comicrom, a BPO company in Chile.<br/> Together with other growth initiatives, including expansion into Brazi), Mexico, China, and Hungary,</mark> and setting up strategic units to pursue new opportunities in the financial services products space or new services such as remote infrastructure management and platform based BPO, TCS set the stage for positioning its brand and its offerings to global customers. Concurrently, a strong talent localization initiative was being undertaken: the number of non-Indian employees rapidly increased to over 10,000 at the end of 2008–2009, including 1,200 in China and over 6,000 in Latin America,<mark> creating a multinational, multicultural global organization. The company's greatest asset is its young work force, whose synergy and vitalit extend beyond TCS and into the community. Employee engagement channels like Maitree, for example, offer employees the opportunity to contribute to their communities in a number of ways - education, health care, and conservation</mark> among other areas.<br/> Despite its size, TCS has stayed true to its roots of building collaborative models of development, reaching out to work with partners, venture capitalists, academia, and government in order to innovate.<br/> These reflect the new models of innovation where global teams work virtually to create and build new solutions and ideas. Being at the heart of this system TCS has been able to leverage its relationships to build a network of innovation labs and create new solutions to address customer challenges.<br/>| The global sites enable FTS model opportunities and I can see that the South American sites have additional advantage of matching closely with US time zones. <br/><br/> There is a deliberate effort made to engage employees with communities in various ways. |
|<mark>In 2009 a new leader emerged: N. Chandrasekaran, popularly known as Chandra, assumed charge as the CEO and MD. He had been at the helm of several key strategic transitions at TCS since 2002 </mark> when he took over the role as head of global sales. As the chief operating officer, he had been the architect of the new organisational structure unveiled in 2008, which created multiple agile business units focusing on domains and markets as well as built strategic business units in order to pursue new initiatives.<br/> Chandra personifies TCS’s commitment to customer satisfaction and high-quality deliverables. <mark>Through his experience in a variety of operational roles across TCS, he has built a reputation in the IT services industry for his exceptional ability to build and develop new businesses and nurture long-term relationships.</mark> He has also been a champion of software and business quality for the industry.<br/> Under his leadership TCS pioneered the creation of its unique Global Network Delivery Mode across five continents and ventured into new markets including Europe, China, and Latin America, and it added new business lines. At the end of 2009–2010, over 25 percent of TCS revenues came from new services like BPO, infrastructure, assurance, and asset-leveraged solutions, reflecting the effectiveness of this strategy.<br/> Chandra has also driven domain diversification as TCS has into new areas like media and information services, as well as high-technology. All of these have matured into sizeable businesses under his guidance. The philosophies of leadership and delivery excellence and the promise of “experience certainty” are pillars on which the success of TCS is cemented. <mark>Four decades ago, when TCS began to promote the concept of global sourcing in IT and application services, it was a market defining model. Today it is the mainstream model for the global IT industry.</mark> TCS has the same opportunity to create new business models for the future.| Again we see a new leader coming through the ranks, this strategy is working well for this organization. <br/><br/> I had never heard of TCS prior to this module and am amazed and impressed by what it has achived. |

## Country Selection and Impact IT Sourcing: Relationships Between Business Factors and Social Inequality 
### Quotes
*"The ethics of digital sourcing is ultimately a matter for leadership. It must be driven by the leader’s personal motivation and preparedness to be responsible for sourcing 
sustainable, humane, technology services and business processes (Babin and Nicholson 2012)."*  (Higgins & Saadatmandi, 2016, p. 2, para. 1)<br/>
*"there are indications that the rationale underpinning outsourcing strategies is now changing. The most significant change being that, rather than being driven by cost savings, sourcing is being seen as a way to gain access to excellence (Willcocks et al. 2009)."* (Higgins & Saadatmandi, 2016, p. 2, para. 3)<br>
*"The corporate social responsibility (CSR) perspective implies that firms and industry sectors have an onus to justify offshore sourcing in terms of fairness, social responsibility, corporate behaviour, and tax compliance. Consequently, many organisations have started the process of engaging with local communities, raising awareness of the social value they contribute to, and committing to ethical goals like minimum wages, working hours, and halting the use of child labour. These commitments have impacts on employees, suppliers, contractors, subcontractors, local communities and even customers."*  (Higgins & Saadatmandi, 2016, p. 2, para. 6)<br/>
*"We also noted a strong negative correlation between GSLI Financial Attractiveness and life expectancy for new births (figure 3, page 7). This suggests that as the average number of years a new born child would be expected to live increases so the financial attractiveness of that country or region declines. Controversially this correlation could be interpreted as; the longer the workforce lives, the less financially attractive the destination."* (Higgins & Saadatmandi, 2016, p. 6, para. 3)<br/>
*"strategic sourcing decisions may not prove to be so strategic as countries with long established outsourcing reputations appear able to retain competitive advantage in the market for offshore outsourcing in defined specialisms and services."* (Higgins & Saadatmandi, 2016, p. 8, para. 2) <br/>
**This is interesting in the Irish context; that we may maintain our Global Position despite becoming more expensive over time. I wonder about the unbalanced impact of creating offshoring hubs, not just for large countires but even in Ireland's case do we see investment concentrated into small areas of cities to the detriment of other parts of the country? Are results for wealth showing everyone benefits or is there an imbalance being created?** <br/>
*" sourcing decisions are not value neutral, they impact individuals, regions and national economies. Nor it seems are sourcing decisions based only upon commercial arguments, many other factors come into play, including personal, emotional and cultural."* (Higgins & Saadatmandi, 2016, p. 10, para 1)<br/>

### Quotes

*"The first issues lies in the uneven distribution of economic advancement within the country incurred by the introduction of software and services outsourcing hubs (Heeks 1999; Kumar 2005)."* (Abbott, 2013, p. 29, para. 1)<br/>
**- This is also the concern I had when reading the Higgins and Saadatmandi (2016) paper** <br/>
*"whether export-only IT services models are ultimately sustainable"* (Abbott, 2013, p. 29, para. 1) <br/>
**- I see ties with previous readings about the importance of not just having offshoring hubs for international companies but to also develop local markets which will be mutually beneficial to the community and the service provider.** <br/>
*"Researchers are unsure of the specific "mix" of conditions that will lead to success"* (Abbott, 2013, p. 29, para. 1) <br/>
**- Regarding emulating the success in Ireland and India.** <br/>
**This paper warns us to use attractiveness indices with caution.**
