## We have a problem Heuston (case)

### Main Case

|Text|Comments|
|---|---|
|Tom runs a <mark>product concept and design</mark> company that handles <mark>high-level web and marketing activities</mark> while <mark>outsourcing development</mark>. Although his business is <mark>located in the digital campus</mark> beside Heuston Station he claims there are just <mark>too few (affordable) software engineers in the Irish market</mark> for a small firm like his <mark>to build up its own development capability</mark>, especially as <mark>much of the work can be sourced online</mark>. He <mark>contracts software implementation and delivery to a small number of trusted outside firms</mark> that he has worked with over the years. Tom <mark>handles client, the requirements, and sources delivery from these contacts</mark>. Tom thinks of the software code that he sources as something that just 'gets the job done'; "yes <mark>code is intellectual property but you can't be precious about code.</mark> For me it's the relationship with my client, building up a joint understanding of how we want a 'thing' to work. To be honest <mark>I couldn't care less about the code as something I own"</mark>. | "Affordable Engineers" indicates to me this is a cost desision. <br/><br/>The idea that the code is IP but not something he owns appears to be contradictory. <br/><br/> "I couldn't care less about the code", the thing that is his product, what he sells. This to me is a red flag, another indication that the motovator for Tom is profit, not producing something 'good' which engineers would value. | 
|The CMS project was <mark>a nice earner in 2005 but now five years later, it is becoming a bit of a headache</mark>. The <mark>original developer had moved to America but passed the source code to Tom who in turn contracted a firm in India to maintain and develop it</mark>. The Indian firm was founded by Suhas and a number of partners who were IT professionals and had worked together previously in Europe. <mark>Suhas had taken on the CMS contract almost as a favor to Tom and the original developer, a personal friend</mark>. As it happened <mark>neither Suhas nor the developers on his team had ever met Tom in person or dealt directly with Tom's clients</mark> (CMS's customers and users). | The basis for the Indian contract does not have a good foundation; both Tom and Suhas relied on a third party as their reason for working together. The lack of connection between Tom and the supplier leaves little opportunity to build trust. | 
|Tom <mark>managed all contact with India, usually through Suhas but occasionally contacting the developers assigned to the CMS project by email, Skype or phone</mark>. Pune, called the Oxford of the East by India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, is home to many high tech, consultancy and software companies centred around a vibrant community of universities, research institutes and colleges. Pune competes for international software outsourcing business with other locations in India and across the World. However <mark>Suhas's view has always been that Indian engineers should innovate and add value, rather than just take part in an international outsourcing race to the bottom in terms of cost or manpower</mark>. He <mark>founded the firm on principles of integrity and fairness</mark>... "knowledge has power, but it takes time to acquire and <mark>it is only useful if it is shared and used!</mark>" "I always feel that <mark>we can not be threat to our clients because the end customer always prefers to have a local company to deal with</mark> which can outsource the work to outside world." | Suhas is underestimating the value they can bring to international clients, feeling that customers prefer local companies is just a feeling. In reality Suhas is in a prime location with a highly educated workforce available and I believe customers would much prefer a better solution to a local solution. If not convinced by that arguement Suhas could consider offshoring 'front end' sales to act as a local gateway to thier services in India. | 
|The CMS project has a <mark>history, characterised by periods of intense involvement (development and delivery work) followed by gaps of months at a time with little or no contact.</mark> The <mark>engineers</mark> who had worked on it over the years were <mark>often overwhelmed</mark>, picking up where the project had left off and working on fixes or new features with few opportunities for feedback with the end customer. <mark>A release could be delivered after which it might take Tom a week or more to report back on the quality or its acceptance.</mark> This sort of <mark>stop-start, delayed back and forwards was not typical for Suhas's other contracts.</mark> <mark>Suhas felt that the CMS was a perfectly good application</mark> that already satisfied the requirements, however <mark>Tom's point of view was that the customer was always right, if the customer was unhappy then it was a bug and it had to be fixed.</mark> For Tom <mark>just understanding a customer's problem took time and effort, explaining it to Suhas or one of his engineers complicated things further.</mark> In spite of this <mark>Tom was concerned to keep the customer at 'arms length' from India,</mark> after all, if they dealt directly with each other <mark>what was the point of having Tom in the relationship?</mark> Suhas felt <mark>there could never be an issue of 'going behind' Tom</mark>, he reasoned that Tom owned the CMS, it was Tom's property. <mark>What Suhas wanted was for his engineers to communicate directly with the end- user so they could clarify the requirements, satisfy them completely, identify and fix bugs, get on with the job and get paid.<mark> | By continuing the current arrangement Suhas is in danger of having poor moral and high turnover as the engineers face very demanding development cycles.  <br/> Suhas' organisation may also be tainted by being associated with a product that has poor requirement definition (treated as bugs), and has slow reaction times for product fixes. <br/> <br/> My advice to Suhas would be to offer Tom an option to become a sales front for CMS and allow Suhas and his team to work with customers directly. This would allow Suhas' team produce products and features that were designed with the customer so that the customer can be part of acceptance testing before release. <br/> |  

### CMS: Content Management System(s)  

|Text|Comments| 
|---|---| 
|Content management systems are applications for managing and structuring information and data accessed and delivered over the Internet. The term CMS is often synonymous with 'portal' or web site however several crucial features distinguish a CMS from other internet services including: publication workflow, fine grained user roles and privileges, extensive data/object types (event, wiki, news, chat, blog, slideshow, video, audio, forms, mail, surveys, RSS), TTW (Through The Web) administration and use, extendible via Javascript and other programming methods. A general overview of different CMSs is available at the cmsmatrix.org. cmsmatrix.org enables feature comparisons between the many CMS product/applications available. | |
