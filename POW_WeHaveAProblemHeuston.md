## We have a problem Heuston (case)

### Main Case

|Text|Comments|
|---|---|
|Tom runs a <mark>product concept and design</mark> company that handles <mark>high-level web and marketing activities</mark> while <mark>outsourcing development</mark>. Although his business is <mark>located in the digital campus</mark> beside Heuston Station he claims there are just <mark>too few (affordable) software engineers in the Irish market</mark> for a small firm like his <mark>to build up its own development capability</mark>, especially as <mark>much of the work can be sourced online</mark>. He <mark>contracts software implementation and delivery to a small number of trusted outside firms</mark> that he has worked with over the years. Tom <mark>handles client, the requirements, and sources delivery from these contacts</mark>. Tom thinks of the software code that he sources as something that just 'gets the job done'; "yes <mark>code is intellectual property but you can't be precious about code.</mark> For me it's the relationship with my client, building up a joint understanding of how we want a 'thing' to work. To be honest <mark>I couldn't care less about the code as something I own"</mark>. | "Affordable Engineers" indicates to me this is a cost decision. <br/><br/>The idea that the code is IP but not something he owns appears to be contradictory. <br/><br/> "I couldn't care less about the code", the thing that is his product, what he sells. This to me is a red flag, another indication that the motovator for Tom is profit, not producing something 'good' which engineers would value. | 
|The CMS project was <mark>a nice earner in 2005 but now five years later, it is becoming a bit of a headache</mark>. The <mark>original developer had moved to America but passed the source code to Tom who in turn contracted a firm in India to maintain and develop it</mark>. The Indian firm was founded by Suhas and a number of partners who were IT professionals and had worked together previously in Europe. <mark>Suhas had taken on the CMS contract almost as a favor to Tom and the original developer, a personal friend</mark>. As it happened <mark>neither Suhas nor the developers on his team had ever met Tom in person or dealt directly with Tom's clients</mark> (CMS's customers and users). | The basis for the Indian contract does not have a good foundation; both Tom and Suhas relied on a third party as their reason for working together. The lack of connection between Tom and the supplier leaves little opportunity to build trust. | 
|Tom <mark>managed all contact with India, usually through Suhas but occasionally contacting the developers assigned to the CMS project by email, Skype or phone</mark>. Pune, called the Oxford of the East by India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, is home to many high tech, consultancy and software companies centred around a vibrant community of universities, research institutes and colleges. Pune competes for international software outsourcing business with other locations in India and across the World. However <mark>Suhas's view has always been that Indian engineers should innovate and add value, rather than just take part in an international outsourcing race to the bottom in terms of cost or manpower</mark>. He <mark>founded the firm on principles of integrity and fairness</mark>... "knowledge has power, but it takes time to acquire and <mark>it is only useful if it is shared and used!</mark>" "I always feel that <mark>we can not be threat to our clients because the end customer always prefers to have a local company to deal with</mark> which can outsource the work to outside world." | Suhas is underestimating the value they can bring to international clients, feeling that customers prefer local companies is just a feeling. In reality Suhas is in a prime location with a highly educated workforce available and I believe customers would much prefer a better solution to a local solution. If not convinced by that arguement Suhas could consider offshoring 'front end' sales to act as a local gateway to thier services in India. | 
|The CMS project has a <mark>history, characterised by periods of intense involvement (development and delivery work) followed by gaps of months at a time with little or no contact.</mark> The <mark>engineers</mark> who had worked on it over the years were <mark>often overwhelmed</mark>, picking up where the project had left off and working on fixes or new features with few opportunities for feedback with the end customer. <mark>A release could be delivered after which it might take Tom a week or more to report back on the quality or its acceptance.</mark> This sort of <mark>stop-start, delayed back and forwards was not typical for Suhas's other contracts.</mark> <mark>Suhas felt that the CMS was a perfectly good application</mark> that already satisfied the requirements, however <mark>Tom's point of view was that the customer was always right, if the customer was unhappy then it was a bug and it had to be fixed.</mark> For Tom <mark>just understanding a customer's problem took time and effort, explaining it to Suhas or one of his engineers complicated things further.</mark> In spite of this <mark>Tom was concerned to keep the customer at 'arms length' from India,</mark> after all, if they dealt directly with each other <mark>what was the point of having Tom in the relationship?</mark> Suhas felt <mark>there could never be an issue of 'going behind' Tom</mark>, he reasoned that Tom owned the CMS, it was Tom's property. <mark>What Suhas wanted was for his engineers to communicate directly with the end- user so they could clarify the requirements, satisfy them completely, identify and fix bugs, get on with the job and get paid.<mark> | By continuing the current arrangement Suhas is in danger of having poor moral and high turnover as the engineers face very demanding development cycles.  <br/> Suhas' organisation may also be tainted by being associated with a product that has poor requirement definition (treated as bugs), and has slow reaction times for product fixes. <br/> <br/> My advice to Suhas would be to offer Tom an option to become a sales front for CMS and allow Suhas and his team to work with customers directly. This would allow Suhas' team produce products and features that were designed with the customer so that the customer can be part of acceptance testing before release. <br/> |  

### CMS: Content Management System(s)  

|Text|Comments| 
|---|---| 
|Content management systems are applications for managing and structuring information and data accessed and delivered over the Internet. The term CMS is often synonymous with 'portal' or web site however several crucial features distinguish a CMS from other internet services including: publication workflow, fine grained user roles and privileges, extensive data/object types (event, wiki, news, chat, blog, slideshow, video, audio, forms, mail, surveys, RSS), TTW (Through The Web) administration and use, extendible via Javascript and other programming methods. A general overview of different CMSs is available at the cmsmatrix.org. cmsmatrix.org enables feature comparisons between the many CMS product/applications available. | |

* Social Capital
* Knowledge Transfer
<br/>

### Stats

* A Gartner survey found a **50% failure rate for offshore outsourcing initiatives** (Aron and Singh, 2005).
* A survey of 204 software developers found that **46%** viewed the **work performed by the offshore teams to be of poor quality** (Carter, 2006).
* Ventoro’s survey of over 5200 executives from North America and Europe found that nearly **28%** of respondents experienced **cost increases** and another **25% did not generate any cost savings with offshore out sourcing** (Hatch, 2005).

**Conversely**, successes in the effort to offshore IT work are also reported in practitioner outlets:<br/>
* A survey of 38 companies in North America and Europe, of which 85% were involved in offshore outsourcing of IT work, found that **89% were satisfied with their offshore outsourcing initiatives** (Beal, 2004).
* A DiamondCluster survey of 210 buyers found that offshore outsourcing satisfaction rates were **high, but falling from 79 to 62% between 2004 and 2005** (Diamond Cluster, 2005).

#### 1

Social capital is simply the idea that knowledge and resources are exchanged, work gets done, and value is created through social relationships. In the context of outsourcing who the supplier knows in the client organization is the key to ensuring what value the supplier delivers. Conversely, who the client knows in the supplier organization is often a key to ensuring which supplier resources will be devoted to the client’s account to ensure value. Research suggests that once social capital is built, many benefits follow.
These benefits include increased efficiency, more cooperative behavior, higher levels of trust, less need for costly monitoring, and most importantly– increased innovation (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998).

#### 2

The Inkpen and Tsang (2005) model represents the theoretical framework we used to classify the practices US Manufacturing employed. This model, described below, is closely linked with many research areas. Namely, the bodies of literature related to trust, knowledge transfer, social capital, cross-cultural issues, and geographically dispersed teams are clearly relevant. Specifically, researchers have addressed the role of trust.  

#### 3

this paper focuses on the creation of social capital and knowledge transfer within a **strategic alliance**.

#### 4

A strategic alliance ‘can be formed by firms located in different positions or in the same position in the value chain’ Inkpen and Tsang (2005).
Firms enter into a strategic alliance voluntarily with the idea of a common benefit resulting from the arrangement.

#### 5
Looking back, the manager of the SCE and his staff underestimated the need for extensive domain knowledge transfer (product, process, and market) as well as their own expertise in managing an offshore project. (Rottman, 2008, p.34, para. 8)

#### 6
 migrating the trained employees offshore to train offshore employees creates a talent and knowledge vacuum on-site and severs many professional and personal connections that were created. To address this issue, US Manufacturing overlapped the supplier’s new on site resource with the old one for between 3 and 6 months.
While this approach is expensive, the two on-site employ ees were able to establish common frames of reference and transfer relationships and connections to the new employee. (Rottman, 2008, p.35, para. 8)

#### 7
The use of multiple suppliers created larger social networks thus increasing US Manufacturing’s ability to both create social capital and manage knowledge transfer.
While it may seem counter-intuitive that increasing the number of suppliers would increase the social capital between teams, the SCE found that exposure to divergent engagement models, vendors with different work processes and styles, and vendors with unique expertise, broadened the outlook of the internal employees. Specifically, internal teams were able to enhance their own skill sets and increase their levels of expertise and confidence by working with developers from multiple vendors. (Rottman, 2008, p.36, para. 8)

#### 8
Considering the proprietary nature of the software the SCE developed, they faced an interesting problem: how to transfer enough knowledge to enable successful product development while protecting their trade secrets. To mitigate this risk, the SCE (1) unitized projects into small segments of work and (2) dispensed these segments among three offshore suppliers to effectively distribute the intellectual property. They viewed their intellectual property as a puzzle. By distributing small pieces among three suppliers, no one supplier can assemble the puzzle on their own. (Rottman, 2008, p.37, para. 5)

#### 9
When the manager of the SCE finally made the trip to Bangalore, India to visit the people he had worked with for 2 years, but had never met face to face, he realized the high value of the trip. During his 2-week trip, he visited both the large suppliers and the boutique firm.
It was not only the meetings themselves that created the connections. Rather, face-to-face interactions allowed for a level of social interaction that was impossible during teleconferences or email conversations. (Rottman, 2008, p.39, paras. 2,4)

#### 10
researchers have identified separate types of trust. Namely, companion trust, competence trust, and commitment trust (Newell and Swan, 2000). In the case of US Manufacturing, commitment trust, which is ‘central in proprietary networks where financial, property, or intellectual rights of the network relationships are at least partly defined’ (Newell and Swan, 2000: 1295), represented the type of trust needed for fostering knowledge transfer. It was this type of trust that allowed the internal teams to fully engage the offshore teams without fear of damaging their own career goals. (Rottman, 2008, p.41, paras. 10)

#### 11
CIOMagazine reported in 2003 that savings may not be realized because the transaction costs (vendor selection, transitioning work, layoffs and retention, lost productivity, additional processes, and managing the contract) of offshore outsourcing can be as high as eight times the cost of the offshore labor.
                 
#### Thoughts
Initially did not recognize the importance of the domain knowledge, therefor this knowledge was not transferred to the supplier resulting in early failure (round 1) of the outsourcing initiative. Similarly in the CMS case the importance of transferring requirements to the supplier is not prioritised, Tom insists on maintaining the customer - supplier gap despite his own lack of understanding and the delays this introduces.
